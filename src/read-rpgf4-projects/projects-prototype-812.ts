      "Reserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum, Base and Arbitrum to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming onchain.\n\nFor example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1) Ugly Cash - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2) Sentz - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.\n\nReserve Protocol has been live on Mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum collectively for over a year now with no security incidents. TVL has grown to over $160M, 8 major audits have been completed, and a $5M ImmuneFi bug bounty continues to contribute to the safety. Additionally, the overcollateralization to protect against depegs was put to test during the Silicon Valley related USDC depeg in March 2023, which led to a successful re-collateralization of eUSD holders.\n\nOn Base, Reserve Protocol has over $25m TVL on Base, $13m of which is Base Native with the remainder bridged from Mainnet. RTokens are playing a strong role in growing the DeFi ecosystem on Base with several integrations and deep liquidity. RToken pools account for over $30m of Total Pool TVL on Aerodrome alone. Growth of RTokens on Base also has second order benefits for the Base's DeFi ecosystem since RTokens are composed of other assets in the ecosystem. For example, hyUSD is a base-native flatcoin that is 100% backed by a collateral basket of USDC which is supplied on Aave and Compound to earn revenue, which is then distributed to hyUSD holders and governance stakers. The market cap of hyUSD has grown to a point where hyUSD collateral makes up 6% of all USDC supplied on Compound and 4% of all USDC supplied on Aave!\n\nI am Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs - the Reserve Protocol Core Team. I have overseen overall strategy at Reserve and have overseen protocol growth from $23M to $160M TVL in the past 9 months.",

Avantis allows traders to long / short all kinds of assets with leverage, while retaining full custody of their funds. The capital for this comes from onchain LPs who passively market-make all trading activity. All trades and liquidity provisioning happens in USDC. \n\nSince our launch on Base in February this year, here's what we've achieved:\n\n1. 8,400 traders\n2. 96,000 trades \n3. Organic yield paid to LPs: $550,000 \n4. Total Trading Volume: $550M (10%+ coming from real world assets like forex and metals!). \n5. TVL: $7.5M (capped)\n\nNote: all protocol stats can be verified onchain as well as at: avantisfi.com/analytics\nToday, we’re looking to apply to RPGF to revolutionize the derivatives market. While there are several off-chain or hybrid exchanges available, we firmly believe in constructing a completely on-chain future through a permissionless platform for both RWAs and crypto assets, fueled by LPs and traders. We’re exclusive to the Superchain, committed to building a sustainable exchange long-term, and are just getting started.\n\nIn a matter of 3 short months, we've established ourselves as one of the leading destinations for Superchain (and specifically Base network) perp traders and LPs. We plan to keep going deeper into the Base stack, having already integrated Coinbase Pay to onramp users seamlessly, and are in the process of integrating CB smart wallets. We have three simple goals: \n\n1) RWA Adoption: Get more real world asset traders onchain (the onchain market currently lacks this diversity of traders. We believe we can onboard them effectively.)\n2) Superchain as a Derivatives Hub: Make Base (and the Superchain) the premier destination for onchain perpetuals trading and market-making. \n3) Democratize market-making: Provide competitive and safe yields for USDC LPs on Base, while giving them custom risk management tools. That is, we want to allow passive LPs the opportunity to market-make complex derivatives the same way institutions do, which is the true and original promise of DeFi.",

In fact this mission has remained unaltered ever since we wrote about it in our introduction blog in 2023 here: https://flintlabs.medium.com/flint-labs-next-chapter-7e56a87f4f5e\n\nIn our 9 months of operation, we have boldly explored various offerings for different trader segments. We identified two primary trader segments: pro traders desiring orderbook functionality and tools, and those seeking a simpler UX for multi-chain exploration. So we built LogX Pro for the former and LogX OG for the latter.\n\nLogX Pro is an Orderbook based Perp Dex which is live on Optimism Main-net, Arbitrum  and Base Network.\n\nLogX OG is a Perp DEX which is based on our own AMM pools.\n\n**Our Competitive Edge and Uniqueness:**\n\n- Low-Cost, High Liquidity Offering: LogX offers unmatched cost efficiency and high liquidity across multiple trading pairs, setting a new benchmark in the decentralized trading space.\n- Technological Superiority: Our innovative DAMN based AMM pool enables us to launch a perpetual dex on newer networks and ecosystems like Mode network at a speed unheard of. We were the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network and bootstrapped liquidity to more than $3M in TVL and $1.3B in trading volume\n\n**Growth**\n\nLogX has been one of the fastest growing Perp DEXes on layer 2 networks. We were also the first perp dex to deploy on Mode Network in the first week of Main-net launch and are still the largest perp dex on Mode Network. We were the preferred strategic launch partner for Mode Network. \n\nSharing some metrics for LogX’s performance on the Mode Network.\n\n- TVL: $3M\n- Unique wallet addresses (lifetime): 30,000\n- Total trading volume lifetime(March-May): $1.3B\n- Avg DAU(last 30 days): 250\n\nLogX is also deployed on Optimism Main-net through their LogX Pro product which is an Orderbook based Perp Dex powered by the Orderly Network and has crossed $12B in trading volume with more than 30,000 wallets on the Optimism and Arbitrum Network combined.\n\nLogX’s overall performance across all the deployed L2s can be found here: https://app.logx.trade/dashboard\n\nThe whole premise of LogX is based built upon composability. LogX does not only integrate with other composable protocols, but other protocols can also integrate LogX. Applications like wallets, copy trading platforms, analytics platforms, etc. can find seamless composability with LogX.\n\nThis is important to us because LogX would not have existed if not for the composability of other protocols. We owe our existence to it, and want to ensure that other protocols and apps can build on top of LogX to unlock new value props.',

      "Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports verified public goods projects to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. We build and advance novel fundraising mechanisms like quadratic funding, donor rewards, and decentralized project curation.\n\n## Giveth supports P2P donations on Optimism and Base.  \n\nGiveth has been live on Optimism since 2023, enabling projects to accept Optimism donations (approx. $330k USD raised by hundreds of projects on OP Mainnet as of June 5, 2024). Donations on Giveth are truly P2P without even contracts in the middle, so the donations we facilitate in the platform can't be included in our metrics in this application.\n\nThrough our GIVbacks program, we reward donors to verified projects with GIV on Optimism, having distributed  6.64 million GIV on OP Mainnet (from launch to June 11, 2024).  \n\nAs an additional onboarding effort for high-trust community members, we have been offering 25 OP to each project on Giveth who passes our verification system requirements, and adds an Optimism recipient address (296 projects onboarded so far). \n\nTo enhance these onboarding efforts, we have been running quadratic funding rounds that require verified projects to add an Optimism address, with matching pools on Optimism so far totaling approximately $83,000. \n\n## How it works\n\nGiveth goes beyond “just donations” with the following features:\n\n* GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects get rewarded with GIV on OP Mainnet. This flips the script on tax-deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.\n* GIVpower - Users can lock their GIV tokens on OP Mainnet to earn a yield and get GIVpower. People can use GIVpower to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher, and in turn, their donors are rewarded with more GIVbacks, similar to the veToken model. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!\n* Quadratic Funding - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.\n\n## Who uses it\n\nCurrently, over 3,400 projects have raised $2.8m from 58,600+ donations from over 16,600 donor addresses on Giveth. \n\nTo understand how deep our link with the Optimism ecosystem is, if we consider only Optimism numbers, we have 799 projects, 4012 donors, 17,500+ donations, and $329k+.\n\nProjects that want to get to the next level can apply to be “Verified” as a public goods creator, providing information about their impact history and reputation at stake.\n\nGiveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new ecosystems of donors, while inspiring them to dive deeper down the blockchain rabbit hole.\n\nSo far in 2024, we have made HUGE progress, running four quadratic funding rounds supporting donations on Optimism with the following results:\n\nTotal in matching pools: $107,563\nIndividual donations: $65,500\nProjects participating: 249 \nUnique donors: 1914\nDonations: 1433\n\nGiving Season Round  (December 19, 2023 - January 2, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/qf-giving-season-round-results-december-19-2023-january-2-2024/1305\n\nMetaPool APAC Round (February 19-29, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/meta-pool-apac-qf-round-results-feb-19-29-2024/1358\n\nENS Builders Round (March 25-April 8, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/ens-builders-qf-round-march-25-april-8-2024/1410\n\nGalactic Giving Round (May 2-16, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/galactic-giving-round-results-may-2-16-2024/1445\n\nWe also launched loads of features including a custom donation widget, a project curation program, and streaming donations.\n\nWe sincerely thank the Optimistic community for allowing us to participate and build in such a fantastic ecosystem.",

It has been empowering developers with a crypto-native financial primitive, money streaming, and a modular smart contracts framework to build applications that leverage a formula-based balance and gasless, liquid, ongoing value transfer.\n\nTo date 31,769 streams have been started on Optimism and 577,985 on Base for a combined total volume of over $170M.\n\nSuperfluid is designed to minimize its TVL in favor of making assets available to sender or recipient at all times, minimizing funds locked in smart contracts. As such its impact is better measures in total volume transferred, number of total or active streams, total number of users and daily active users. When measuring the protocol activity it's important to not only rely on the on-chain transaction to smart contracts, but also on the the inner mechanics of the protocol (i.e. by evaluating the actions triggered via callData or by using the protocol subgraph).\n\nOn the alignment with Optimism and Retro Funding Round 4\n- Superfluid is builder-centric. A developer tool with clear focus on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, it’s additive to Optimism’s own goals.\n- Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries, Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals, Airdrops, Grants distribution as well as entirely novel applications in DeFi, SocialFi and beyond.\n\nSuperfluid Protocol has been used by the Optimism Foundation to stream the RPGF3 grants, and will be used again in the upcoming RPGF4 round, providing the rails for a seamless funds distribution.\n\nThe protocol has been designed around builders and developers, with a set of tools available for building, debugging and data retrieval that empower new applications development.

The fixed price of music is suffocating artists, with streaming services refusing to unlock the full value of music and failing to allow music fans to directly support artists. As a result, only 0.1% of musicians make a living wage from their art.\n\nOn Sound, artists can release their music and sell digital collectibles to their fans. Listeners can discover and collect new music to prove they were an early supporter and engage with their favorite artists.

    contributionDescription:
      'Trash NFTs is a project built on Base that leverages the unique properties of the ERC404 token standard. We had the idea for Trash NFTs as a way to combine artichokelord’s incredible artwork with novel tech to create something fun that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible for a memecoin. We chose to build Trash NFTs on Base because we believe in the future of the Superchain and the supportive community of builders it fosters.\n\nBetween the two contracts associated with Trash NFTs, the project has generated over 1300 onchain transactions.\n\nDemo video: https://youtu.be/KORe_xnJx1w?si=6V52TlkOfLz3hySz\nVideo of artichokelord drawing the art: https://warpcast.com/trashnfts/0xc65d2a4e\n\nERC404 is an experimental token standard pioneered by Pandora on February 2, 2024. ERC404 tokens embrace characteristics of both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens: They are “semi-fungible,” enabling both highly liquid markets and uniqueness within a single asset. This allows collectors to sell their tokens when they want and in pieces, if they’d like, as well as introduces the ability to reroll your NFT traits by making more transactions. ERC404s are inherently fractionalized and designed to work natively with existing DeFi protocols. While innovative, it’s important to note that ERC404 is also experimental.\n\nWhen we first launched $TRASH, we forked Pandora’s contract and raced to be one of the first, if not the first project to deploy an ERC404 on Base. Pandora’s contract was limited to 5 variations of artwork, images that implied a reveal down the line, so we followed suit with 5 closed-lid NFTs of different rarities. Our next goal was to have a PFP collection with the lids removed, so we came up with the idea to create a new contract where you could stash your $TRASH and mint a Dumpster Diver. This contract is named The Dumpster. It is open source and available to any other ERC404 token that wishes to fork it to enable their holders to redeem their ERC404 token for an ERC721.\n\nIn addition to the ability to mint an ERC721 by depositing an ERC404, the Dumpster contract enables holders of Dumpster Divers PFP tokens to burn their ERC721 to redeem the original ERC404 that the ERC721 was minted with (retaining the rarity and token ID). A small cleaning fee (0.00042069 ETH, updatable by governance) is charged, and this mechanism can also be used for regenerating/rerolling or ‘recycling’, Dumpster Diver PFPs to get the desired traits.\n\nWe have grown to 185 holders and have generated $44k from trade fees (50% of which is $TRASH and 100% of which is reinvested in providing liquidity for our pools), and 1,654,148 DEGEN (~$40k) from liquidity mining rewards. We were also a finalist in the Backdrop Build V3 Accelerator Program (top 5% of applicants). \n\nTrash NFTs have built an effective machine: by owning the LPs that facilitate the swaps into $TRASH we capture 1% of the volume and store that in our treasury. We have two liquidity pools: 1) TRASH/ETH and 2) TRASH/ DEGEN, the rapidly growing meme token with utility in the Farcaster network and beyond. This exposes Trash NFTs to volatility, which generates more revenue because arbitrage bots stabilize the price across pools. \n\nTrash NFTs is also governed by a DAO called Waste Management that was initially allocated 20% of all $TRASH tokens. This DAO collects the cleaning fees associated with trait rerolls as well as the transaction fees and LP rewards from its DeFi activities. Finally, Trash NFTs has entered the meatspace by hosting a trash pickup event during Farcon 2024 with /humankind. \n\nWe are proud of Trash NFTs, as it has maintained and proven to be a sound investment for its holder base while operating successfully. There are definite improvements we continue working toward: 1) expanding growth efforts to the broader 404 ecosystem with partnerships (such as Scattering.io with which we have built a relationship) and promotion, 2) revamping The Dumpster website for a more seamless experience and 3) engaging the community to take leadership in expanding the DAO.',

In that time, is has processed over $200 Million in asset value. Nearly 14,000 addresses have registered to receive private payments, and more than 69,000 transactions have been occurred. As a tool for private payments, Umbra is especially useful on an L2 network like Optimism, where low fees make the payments use case more tenable than mainnet. Umbra also launched on Base in April 2024.\n\nScopeLift, the creators of Umbra, have also contributed to several EIPs to help standardize stealth addresses for all EVM networks. It is our hope these standardization efforts will be the next step to making Stealth Address technology broadly accessible and useful to all in the ecosystem.',

That's right you can send coins directly to your friends using the social feed and emojis. To date over 378,000 Floaties have been sent and over 73,000 transactions submitted. \n\nWe also have an off-chain tipping mechanism where people can tip Warpcast posts they like using the Ham emoji 🍖. People receive a daily allocation of Ham based on their community points.\n\nThe Ham ecosystem is backed by a memecoin on Base called $TN100x. Part of Ham, I launched an NFT project called The Based LP. Each Based LP is backed by a certain amount of $TN100x. The NFT can be burnt to redeem the $TN100x - 60% of the backing is redeemed immediately while the remaining 40% goes to backing the remaining NFTs.\n\nWe also recently launched $PHAM - an index style asset backed by 6 Base memecoins. Through owning a single token you get exposure to all 6. \n\nLastly we are launching Ham chain next week. Its an L3 built using the OP stack.",

      'Keng Lernitas is a meme project that has been called the “biggest meme on Optimism” upon its creation. It began as an experiment by Kain Warwick to test the new gas costs after the implementation of EIP-4844. Consequently, a curated degen ecosystem, featuring $2192/$ZORKSEES, was born.\n\nNow, to explain what we do, let’s explore our brief history. Last March, Kain airdropped $2192 on Optimism to SNX stakers and asked the brand new holders to burn 90% of their tokens to be “spared” from the oubliettes. This initiated the first alignment test. The newly formed team behind the meme project, including Kain and his brother Grant Warwick, recognized the faithful and rewarded them with airdropped $ZORKSEES tokens on Base. For the next challenge, Keng Lernitas and Zorksees were compelled to “batel.” The team challenged the community to bridge tokens from Solana to Base using Wormhole, and once again, sacrifice tokens by transferring them into a "batel" wallet. The side that achieved the highest TVL would win. In total, more than 40% of the combined supply of $2192/$ZORKSEES has already been burned or sent to "batel" for the promise of glory (https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192).\n\nIn summary, we are an event-driven meme project striving to create value for our community and allies. The newly established governance, called Keng Lernitas Ekosistem, is asking for a grant to continue building on our gamification culture by hosting more games and events. Throughout our journey, we have made fierce allies from the Synthetix and Infinex communities. Now, it is only natural to seek an alliance with the mighty Optimism Superchain!\n\nSome facts:\n\n-Around $250,000 USD of LP/bribes/incentives on Velodrome/Aerodrome was spent by Kain Warwick for experimental purposes\n-35.5% of $2192 supply has been burned\n-27% of $ZORKSEES supply and 8% of $2192 supply was sent to "batel" wallet\n-60k $2192 holders\n-6k $ZORKSEES holders on EVM\n\nSource: https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192 / https://dune.com/nice2win/zorksees',

The competition is fierce! \n\nIt’s hard enough to get exposure to a targeted audience interested in learning about a new blockchain network and its Dapps. It’s even harder to convert them into users when there is more friction than incentives in the onboarding process. Even worse, hundreds of networks are launching every year making it even more challenging to attract and retain new users.\nUnitap aims to change this. \n\nIn Unitap anyone will be able to learn about Web3 from zero, find new networks and dapps, learn how to use them with how-to-do videos, get free gas drips to get started, and do missions to get rewarded for using new products, ALL IN ONE PLACE. Additionally, Unitap is Sybil-resistant therefore all new users will be unique and the incentives won’t be drained by bots or bad actors. \n\nMost future web3 users have not been onboarded yet, these users will come through the path of least resistance and more incentives. Unitap is optimizing for offering both.\n\nUnitap has deployed Gas Tap, Token Tap, and Prize Tap on Optimism.\n\nGas Tap: Unique humans can obtain tiny amounts of gas tokens to get started on Optimism. X claims.\n\nToken Tap: Anyone can distribute any kind of tokens gated by the requirements they wish. Unitap distributed OP as incentives to anyone who claimed from the Gas Tap as a PoC and Glo Dollar distributed 500 USDGLO on Optimism using Token Tap.\n\nPrize Tap: Anyone can create raffles and gate them with the requirements they want.
