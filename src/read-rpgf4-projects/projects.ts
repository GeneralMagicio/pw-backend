    contributionDescription:
      'Minibridge is a "zero-fee" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users\' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded "Best Tool of the Year" in the "PARTY AWARD 2024" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community’s needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don’t charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don’t want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/',

Consequently, a curated degen ecosystem, featuring $2192/$ZORKSEES, was born.\n\nNow, to explain what we do, let’s explore our brief history. Last March, Kain airdropped $2192 on Optimism to SNX stakers and asked the brand new holders to burn 90% of their tokens to be “spared” from the oubliettes. This initiated the first alignment test. The newly formed team behind the meme project, including Kain and his brother Grant Warwick, recognized the faithful and rewarded them with airdropped $ZORKSEES tokens on Base. For the next challenge, Keng Lernitas and Zorksees were compelled to “batel.” The team challenged the community to bridge tokens from Solana to Base using Wormhole, and once again, sacrifice tokens by transferring them into a "batel" wallet. The side that achieved the highest TVL would win. In total, more than 40% of the combined supply of $2192/$ZORKSEES has already been burned or sent to "batel" for the promise of glory (https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192).\n\nIn summary, we are an event-driven meme project striving to create value for our community and allies. The newly established governance, called Keng Lernitas Ekosistem, is asking for a grant to continue building on our gamification culture by hosting more games and events.

      "Webhash.com is a no-code platform designed to empower users to create tokenised, decentralised, and permanent websites seamlessly. Targeting both ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and traditional DNS domains, users can build and deploy robust websites without any coding knowledge, ensuring their web presence is tamper-proof and enduring. These websites are deployed on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and tokenised on Base, providing enhanced security, immutability, and ownership verification, setting a new standard in website development and management.\n\nTokenisation: Each website created on Webhash.com is tokenised on the Base blockchain. This means that every website is represented by a unique token, ensuring clear ownership and provenance. Tokenisation allows for easy transfer and trading of website ownership, creating a seamless and secure way to manage web properties.\n\nDecentralisation: By deploying websites on IPFS, Webhash.com leverages a distributed network of nodes to store and serve content. This decentralised approach eliminates single points of failure, making websites more resilient to censorship and server outages. It ensures that the content remains accessible as long as the network exists, without relying on any central authority.\n\nPermanence: The combination of IPFS and Filecoin ensures that websites are permanent and immutable. Once content is added to IPFS, it is distributed across multiple nodes, making it tamper-proof. Our smart contract on base provides an immutable ledger of ownership and changes, guaranteeing that once a website is created and tokenised, its history and content cannot be altered or erased.\n\nPermanence: The combination of IPFS and Filecoin ensures that websites are permanent and immutable.

Our smart contract on base provides an immutable ledger of ownership and changes, guaranteeing that once a website is created and tokenised, its history and content cannot be altered or erased.\n\n📈 Our Growth in Numbers:\nUser Engagement: We've welcomed over 3,045 users, a testament to the growing interest and trust in decentralised web solutions.\nWebsite Creations: Our platform has enabled the creation of 4,527 decentralised websites, showcasing the diverse applications and creativity of our community.\nStorage Expansion: We're now utilising 95 GB on IPFS, highlighting our commitment to robust and decentralised storage solutions.\n\nPartnerships: \n\nIn our continuous effort to enhance and expand the capabilities of Webhash within the ENS ecosystem, we've taken significant strides in integrating products build within the ENS ecosystem that empower our users and their decentralised creations. \n\n🌐 Eth.limo: Eth.limo has become an integral part of the Webhash ecosystem, providing a seamless way to access decentralised websites with a \".limo\" extension. This integration means every decentralised website created on Webhash is automatically generated with a .limo extension, ensuring a uniform and recognizable domain system for users and visitors alike. Furthermore, all content created on Webhash is pinned on Eth.limo's IPFS node, which not only enhances the reliability and speed of content delivery but also strengthens the decentralised nature of our hosting solutions.\n\nOur collaboration with Eth.limo is further enhanced through the integration of Eth.limo's API, including their Domain over HTTPS (DoH) API, into the Webhash ENS website resolver (browser extension). This advanced integration leverages @ethlimo.eth’s DoH API to efficiently fetch the corresponding IPFS hash or Arweave link associated with a .eth domain. This capability streamlines the process of linking ENS domains to their corresponding decentralised content, ensuring a seamless and efficient resolution system for decentralised web access. \n\n🌍 Namespace: With the integration of Namespace, users can mint subdomains directly on Webhash, offering a layer of personalization and organisation to their decentralised web presence. These subdomains provide a scalable way for users to categorise, manage, and deploy multiple decentralised websites under a unified domain structure, further enriching the Webhash ecosystem.\n\n🔄 Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP): In an exciting development, we're implementing a new feature that allows users to showcase their Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP) numbers directly on their decentralised websites. This block, when added to a site on Webhash, not only highlights the user's engagement within the Ethereum community but also fosters a sense of connectivity and social proof among decentralised web participants. The Ethereum Follow Protocol integration signifies our commitment to leveraging blockchain technology not just for hosting but also for community building and engagement.\n\n🔨 Community Engagement through Buildathons: Our mission to ignite active participation within the ENS community has led to the creation of decentralised websites for ENS domains through Webhash. Our Buildathons, including collaborations like frENS, are key to empowering individuals to develop innovative decentralised digital identities.\n\nBuildathon 1: We gave $1000 to five winners who build decentralised websites\nBuildathon 2: Done in collaboration with frENS. We gave $1000 to five winners who build decentralised websites.\nBuildathon 3: Still in progress we a giving $1200 to five winners\n\n\nKey features of Webhash: \n\nNo-Code Interface: We've created a no-code, user-friendly interface that makes building decentralised websites accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.\nVersatile Content Creation & Integration: Our platform at Webhash enriches the ENS domain experience by enabling users to create a broad spectrum of content types with seamless integrations. We have designed a user-friendly interface that allows for the addition of various standard elements such as avatars with diverse styles, engaging headings, informative paragraphs, and external links, all of which enhance the user's webpage. The integration capabilities of our platform include a suite of options that cater to different media types and functionalities:\n\nSocial Media Integration: Users can showcase their social presence with icons linked to their profiles on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and more, fostering engagement directly from their ENS dwebsite.\n\nMultimedia Content: Embedding capabilities for platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Spotify, and SoundCloud allow users to share a wide range of audiovisual content, from music tracks and podcasts to videos and livestreams.\n\nWeb3 activity blocks: Integrated key web3 projects like Farcaster and POAP so that users can showcase their web3 activity. \n\nInteractive Features: Inclusion of interactive elements such as image sliders, RSS feeds, countdown widgets, and forms elevates the user experience by engaging visitors with dynamic content.\nContent Distribution: Our platform supports file sharing directly from the page, whether it’s audio files, PDF documents, or any downloadable content, making it a versatile tool for content distribution.\nCommunication and Sharing: Integration of communication tools like Discord servers and call-to-action prompts encourages community building and interaction. Additionally, our VCard feature enables users to share contact information in a professional manner.\n\nMonetization: We've integrated payment solutions like PayPal, enabling users to collect payments for products, services, or donations directly through their ENS decentralised website.\n\nCustomization: Advanced customization with custom HTML/CSS/JS and Markdown formatting allows for unique content creation. \n\nCredibility and Engagement: By adding customer reviews and FAQs, users can build credibility and provide valuable information to their audience.\n\nThe combination of these features on the Webhash platform not only empowers users to create comprehensive 'link-in-bio' pages but also extends to more complex decentralised website formats such as blogs, portfolios, and business landing pages. Each feature is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, ensuring that even those with no coding skills can build a professional and aesthetically pleasing online presence on the decentralised web.\n\nSeamless ENS and DNS Domain Connections: We've streamlined the process of connecting ENS and traditional DNS domains to decentralised websites, making it hassle-free and efficient.\nCollaboration with ETH.limo: We've partnered with ETH.limo to ensure optimal speed and availability for the decentralised websites hosted on our platform.\n\nMonetization Through NFTs: We've innovated in monetization by allowing users to mint their website designs as NFTs, creating new economic opportunities within the ENS ecosystem.\nArweave Integration: Our integration with Arweave enables a persistent web presence, ensuring durability and longevity of the content.\n\nSetting Resolvers for Domains: We've simplified the process of setting resolvers for ENS domains, addressing a common challenge faced by users.\n\nSubdomain and Wrapped Domain Support: We've Introduced support for both subdomains and wrapped domains.

    displayName: 'The Sound Ecosystem By Malik Naim',
    contributionDescription:
      "What is Sound Ecos?\n\nMy name is Malik Naim, I am a creative who's most passionate mediums are sound and pen. When I began exploring blockchain technology for my art, my goal was to create a more immersive experience for my fans. I wanted to forge a deeper connection with my audience beyond traditional means, leading to the creation of the Soundverse. This journey began in 2021 with Rap Pack NFTs, where I offered streaming royalties in exchange for holding my music NFTs. While this was a fruitful start, I aimed to dive deeper than merely sharing streaming royalties.\n\nI envisioned a storybook world governed entirely by sound, which led to the development of multiple Music NFT PFP collectibles. These offered rewards such as custom songs, chapter features within the Soundverse story, and various interactive opportunities. As I expanded this world, I focused on building the lore around my original holders and engaged new fans.\n\nI released singles as open editions on Ethereum and Polygon. Discovering Sound XYZ allowed me to launch songs on the Optimism (OP) chain. Throughout 2022, I distributed NFTs through email signups and other messaging methods, onboarding new and existing investors to OP. Influencers from East Asia supported my releases due to the low entry price, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their financial situation, could hold my music. This inclusive approach was well-received by my community.\n\nWorking with P00ls, I developed Sound Coin, which now has 13,000 holders across various L2 chains. My broader vision involves transitioning these Polygon holders to the OP chain with Sound Gold ($SGLD), the main currency for exclusive and immersive experiences. Both tokens offer redeemable content and services, with significant potential for interactivity.\n\nOn the BASE network, I released Based Sound ($BSOUND), an active liquidity and educational token. Buying $BSOUND grants a music meme NFT on BASE, with staking options to earn music NFTs from my Based Music collection. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that connects me with my fans in an intimate way.\n\nAdditionally, I am developing a simple game initially available to beta testers (my top holders) before a wider release on web2 and web3. The game, featuring crypto, music, and popular trends, will integrate blockchain technology, allowing players to earn Sound Coin and Sound Gold based on their performance. This game will strengthen my ecosystem and benefit the blockchain as a whole.\n\nBenefits of the Soundverse Ecosystem:\n\n\t1.\tSound Gold:\n\t•\tAttracts my existing community and new users interested in music-related utility products on the OP chain.\n\t•\tFosters consistent interactions and utility through my frequent music and content releases.\n\t•\tAttracts high-level investors to the OP chain once the proof of concept is established.\n\t2.\tWeb3 Integrated Game:\n\t•\tAppeals to music fans, gamers, and P2E crypto users, exposing more ETH-based users to the OP chain.\n\t•\tGenerates cash flow through in-game ads, with a portion used to add liquidity to Sound Gold and Sound Coin.\n\t•\tFeatures my music catalog during gameplay, enhancing my brand.\n\t•\tReleases a Music NFT PFP collection on OP, with traits that provide gameplay rewards.\n\t3.\tSound Coin (Polygon):\n\t•\tFacilitates the onboarding of Polygon holders to OP, leveraging over 300,000 interactions and weekly earnings.\n\nThe Sound Ecos is continuously evolving. I am proud of the progress and believe the Soundverse Ecosystem can serve as a blueprint for other artists seeking to build their identity and foster greater interactions. If awarded a grant, I would use the funds for further development, initial liquidity for Sound Gold, and additional marketing, promotion, and mint rewards.\n\nI aim to keep the game and coin integration simple, providing a low-risk environment for users to enjoy the blockchain while engaging with my music. Consistent releases on OP/BASE/ZORA and other L2s will remain a cornerstone of my growing ecosystem.",

      'Crypto: The Game (CTG) is an interactive, onchain survival game. Contestants buy in with 0.1 ETH, join tribes, participate in daily challenges, and vote each other out over ten-day seasons until one person wins the entire pot. CTG has been compared to Survivor, Hunger Games, and Squid Game. Players have described it as "dramatic and insanity-inducing," and "the most fun crypto experience in years."\n\nCTG, launched as a unique crypto gaming experience, had players strategizing around the clock. They communicated in tribe-specific chats and faced the potential of being voted out by their tribemates each night. They could gain immunity by topping the daily leaderboard in tribal immunity challenges, which ranged from classic arcade games to digital scavenger hunts and crypto puzzles.\n\nCTG S2, built on Base, was designed with only 800 spots available. These spots sold out in 13 minutes, with each 0.1 ETH NFT contributing to a prize pool of nearly $300,000, which one player won. S2 also featured a new minting mechanic built on Base.\n\nPlayers minted an NFT to secure their spot in The Game. This buy-in contributed toward the grand prize pot. As players were voted out, their NFTs automatically transitioned from "player" to "jury" status, as the final winner is decided by previously eliminated players. This also meant players could sell their NFT at any time, which allowed spectators and former players to buy into the game as it progressed. This mechanic, unique to crypto, created an in-game economy reminiscent of "Deal or No Deal," only possible onchain.\n\nCTG S2 was supported by major sponsors including adidas, Uniswap, Lens, Wormhole, POAP, and Safe, and received media coverage from CoinDesk, Axios, Bankless, Decrypt, and Unchained. Boys Club hosted a daily companion podcast throughout the season. Over 10 days, the season attracted over 100,000 site visits (with more than 50,000 unique visitors), accumulating 4,000+ total hours of gameplay. Players participated from the US, Canada, UK, India, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, France, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe contract was deployed at 0x4DfC7EA5aC59B63223930C134796fecC4258d093 from a special purpose factory at 0x3AbB25038DA5A6eE9F524CC16C7F7EC68Db7EB3b on the base superchain network.',

DeFiLens is a chain abstraction DApp, Which I started to increase user engagement in the DeFi space by simplifying DeFi across chains. We recently launched our MVP and have gained traction, receiving grants from Base Network and Devfolio. Our team of three is continuously improving the product and user acquisition.\n\nWhat is DeFiLens:\nDeFiLens simplifies decentralized finance (DeFi) trading and portfolio management across multiple blockchain networks. It provides a cross-chain rebalancer tool that helps traders manage, diversify, and optimize their portfolios seamlessly. By abstracting the complexities of network switching, asset bridging, and multiple transactions, DeFiLens offers a unified interface that enhances efficiency, reduces gas fees, and automates strategic rebalancing. This enables users to maximize returns and minimize risks in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\n\nHow It Is Going:\nWe have executed 450 cross-chain batches successfully on 4 EVM chains. Each batch contains around 25 transactions, which we simplified into one transaction with a single click. We built DeFiLens frames on Warpcast, garnering around 2,000 views and 200 users trying out our DeFi frames.',

    displayName: 'Trash NFTs',
    contributionDescription:
      'Trash NFTs is a project built on Base that leverages the unique properties of the ERC404 token standard. We had the idea for Trash NFTs as a way to combine artichokelord’s incredible artwork with novel tech to create something fun that pushed the boundaries of what’s possible for a memecoin. We chose to build Trash NFTs on Base because we believe in the future of the Superchain and the supportive community of builders it fosters.\n\nBetween the two contracts associated with Trash NFTs, the project has generated over 1300 onchain transactions.\n\nDemo video: https://youtu.be/KORe_xnJx1w?si=6V52TlkOfLz3hySz\nVideo of artichokelord drawing the art: https://warpcast.com/trashnfts/0xc65d2a4e\n\nERC404 is an experimental token standard pioneered by Pandora on February 2, 2024. ERC404 tokens embrace characteristics of both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens: They are “semi-fungible,” enabling both highly liquid markets and uniqueness within a single asset. This allows collectors to sell their tokens when they want and in pieces, if they’d like, as well as introduces the ability to reroll your NFT traits by making more transactions. ERC404s are inherently fractionalized and designed to work natively with existing DeFi protocols. While innovative, it’s important to note that ERC404 is also experimental.\n\nWhen we first launched $TRASH, we forked Pandora’s contract and raced to be one of the first, if not the first project to deploy an ERC404 on Base. Pandora’s contract was limited to 5 variations of artwork, images that implied a reveal down the line, so we followed suit with 5 closed-lid NFTs of different rarities. Our next goal was to have a PFP collection with the lids removed, so we came up with the idea to create a new contract where you could stash your $TRASH and mint a Dumpster Diver. This contract is named The Dumpster. It is open source and available to any other ERC404 token that wishes to fork it to enable their holders to redeem their ERC404 token for an ERC721.\n\nIn addition to the ability to mint an ERC721 by depositing an ERC404, the Dumpster contract enables holders of Dumpster Divers PFP tokens to burn their ERC721 to redeem the original ERC404 that the ERC721 was minted with (retaining the rarity and token ID). A small cleaning fee (0.00042069 ETH, updatable by governance) is charged, and this mechanism can also be used for regenerating/rerolling or ‘recycling’, Dumpster Diver PFPs to get the desired traits.\n\nWe have grown to 185 holders and have generated $44k from trade fees (50% of which is $TRASH and 100% of which is reinvested in providing liquidity for our pools), and 1,654,148 DEGEN (~$40k) from liquidity mining rewards. We were also a finalist in the Backdrop Build V3 Accelerator Program (top 5% of applicants). \n\nTrash NFTs have built an effective machine: by owning the LPs that facilitate the swaps into $TRASH we capture 1% of the volume and store that in our treasury. We have two liquidity pools: 1) TRASH/ETH and 2) TRASH/ DEGEN, the rapidly growing meme token with utility in the Farcaster network and beyond. This exposes Trash NFTs to volatility, which generates more revenue because arbitrage bots stabilize the price across pools. \n\nTrash NFTs is also governed by a DAO called Waste Management that was initially allocated 20% of all $TRASH tokens. This DAO collects the cleaning fees associated with trait rerolls as well as the transaction fees and LP rewards from its DeFi activities. Finally, Trash NFTs has entered the meatspace by hosting a trash pickup event during Farcon 2024 with /humankind. \n\nWe are proud of Trash NFTs, as it has maintained and proven to be a sound investment for its holder base while operating successfully. There are definite improvements we continue working toward: 1) expanding growth efforts to the broader 404 ecosystem with partnerships (such as Scattering.io with which we have built a relationship) and promotion, 2) revamping The Dumpster website for a more seamless experience and 3) engaging the community to take leadership in expanding the DAO.',

    contributionDescription:
      "Gyroscope is a decentralized protocol providing stablecoin and liquidity infrastructure. Gyroscope includes two main products: an all-weather meta-stablecoin that tokenizes stablecoin risk control and more efficient liquidity pools based on asymmetric concentrated liquidity. Gyroscope's liquidity pools are ideal for key markets including stablecoins, LSTs, and LRTs.\n\nGyroscope has been live on Optimism since July 2023 and has become one of the dominant liquidity sources for wstETH on Optimism with over 258m of volume. With the launch of Gyroscope’s stablecoin GYD on Ethereum in December, the project is well placed to further expand on Optimism now.\n\nGyro Dollars (GYD): a decentralized stablecoin focused on risk control\n\nGYD is fully backed by a basket of assets with pioneering innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level. GYD aims to segment and contain risks from across the asset space with:\n\nAutomated risk diversification rules\n\nOptimized minting and redemption bonding curves that guide the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability\n\nA new resilient oracle and circuit breaker system that handles stress.\n\nGYD is built from first principles on rigorous understanding of DeFi risk. It serves as a principled and non-custodial risk control layer for stablecoin holders and aims to be the safest on-chain stable asset.\n\nE-CLPs: highly efficient and customizable AMMs\n\nGyroscope E-CLPs, standing for elliptic concentrated liquidity pools, are a novel liquidity pool type that enables asymmetric concentration of liquidity. E-CLPs focalize trading of assets along the curve of an ellipse. E-CLPs have several advantages over other liquidity pool types:\n\nE-CLPs are up to 75% more capital efficient than Stableswap liquidity pools.\n\nE-CLPs are highly customizable. They allow a further degree of flexibility as liquidity no longer needs to be spread evenly within uniform price bounds.\n\nE-CLPs don’t require active position management and adapt automatically to yield-accruing assets. The pool deployer takes on responsibility of calibrating and establishing trading parameters upon launch.\n\nE-CLPs package concentrated liquidity into a customizable and passive form that is also easily composable as collateral in other protocols.\n\nRehype E-CLPs: even more efficient E-CLPs that reduce the cost of capital for stablecoin liquidity We just launched an extension of E-CLPs that combine the E-CLP's asymmetric concentrated liquidity with auto-rehypothecation of pool assets to Aave. This launch included a first Rehype pool on Optimism. Rehype pools allow LPs to combine multiple yield sources together to further increase capital efficiency. In Rehype pools, LPs simultaneously earn swap fees, lending yields, and token incentives from Balancer gauges while remaining in direct control (contrary to common rehypothecation in TradFi). This makes pools more profitable and lowers the cost of capital required for stablecoin pools in particular. This also allows pool incentives to stretch further as they don’t need to match Aave yields and only need to provide a small bump on top.\n\n\nRehype pools are a more efficient and safer form of Balancer’s boosted pools, which previously reached 300m TVL, including 12m on Optimism. Rehype pools work with a simple, modular design that is aimed to minimize smart contract risk and doesn’t introduce new smart contract code for the rehypothecation. They instead handle complexity at the more flexible layers of SOR and front end design. They are thus comparatively safer than alternative pool designs as the Rehype pools inherit the safety record of the E-CLPs and only add in Aave risks.\n\nMetrics of Gyroscope:\n\nTotal TVL: 33m USD (4.25m on Optimism)\n\nTotal volume: 1.27b USD (258m on Optimism)\n\nGYD supply: 5.4m USD\n\nMonthly active users: 10k (includes GYD users, LPs, and traders)\n\nOver 2300 LP addresses across current E-CLPs on Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon\n\n13k+ Discord users\n\n3k provably unique early community members\n\n15+ highly involved community members (non-team) who are bootstrapping initial governance delegation and dao-to-dao bd initiatives\n\nDune dashboards: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope\n\nThis grant would be for the initial development entity of the Gyroscope protocol, FTL Labs.",

We have three simple goals: \n\n1) RWA Adoption: Get more real world asset traders onchain (the onchain market currently lacks this diversity of traders. We believe we can onboard them effectively.)\n2) Superchain as a Derivatives Hub: Make Base (and the Superchain) the premier destination for onchain perpetuals trading and market-making. \n3) Democratize market-making: Provide competitive and safe yields for USDC LPs on Base, while giving them custom risk management tools.

    displayName: 'Reserve Protocol',
    contributionDescription:
      "Reserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum, Base and Arbitrum to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming onchain.\n\nFor example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1) Ugly Cash - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2) Sentz - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.\n\nReserve Protocol has been live on Mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum collectively for over a year now with no security incidents. TVL has grown to over $160M, 8 major audits have been completed, and a $5M ImmuneFi bug bounty continues to contribute to the safety. Additionally, the overcollateralization to protect against depegs was put to test during the Silicon Valley related USDC depeg in March 2023, which led to a successful re-collateralization of eUSD holders.\n\nOn Base, Reserve Protocol has over $25m TVL on Base, $13m of which is Base Native with the remainder bridged from Mainnet. RTokens are playing a strong role in growing the DeFi ecosystem on Base with several integrations and deep liquidity. RToken pools account for over $30m of Total Pool TVL on Aerodrome alone. Growth of RTokens on Base also has second order benefits for the Base's DeFi ecosystem since RTokens are composed of other assets in the ecosystem.

    bio: "Reserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum, Base and Arbitrum to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming onchain.\n\nFor example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1) Ugly Cash - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2) Sentz - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.\n\nReserve Protocol has been live on Mainnet, Base, and Arbitrum collectively for over a year now with no security incidents. TVL has grown to over $160M, 8 major audits have been completed, and a $5M ImmuneFi bug bounty continues to contribute to the safety. Additionally, the overcollateralization to protect against depegs was put to test during the Silicon Valley related USDC depeg in March 2023, which led to a successful re-collateralization of eUSD holders.\n\nOn Base, Reserve Protocol has over $25m TVL on Base, $13m of which is Base Native with the remainder bridged from Mainnet. RTokens are playing a strong role in growing the DeFi ecosystem on Base with several integrations and deep liquidity. RToken pools account for over $30m of Total Pool TVL on Aerodrome alone. Growth of RTokens on Base also has second order benefits for the Base's DeFi ecosystem since RTokens are composed of other assets in the ecosystem. For example, hyUSD is a base-native flatcoin that is 100% backed by a collateral basket of USDC which is supplied on Aave and Compound to earn revenue, which is then distributed to hyUSD holders and governance stakers. The market cap of hyUSD has grown to a point where hyUSD collateral makes up 6% of all USDC supplied on Compound and 4% of all USDC supplied on Aave!\n\nI am Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs - the Reserve Protocol Core Team.

    contributionDescription:
      "Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports verified public goods projects to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. We build and advance novel fundraising mechanisms like quadratic funding, donor rewards, and decentralized project curation.\n\n## Giveth supports P2P donations on Optimism and Base.  \n\nGiveth has been live on Optimism since 2023, enabling projects to accept Optimism donations (approx. $330k USD raised by hundreds of projects on OP Mainnet as of June 5, 2024). Donations on Giveth are truly P2P without even contracts in the middle, so the donations we facilitate in the platform can't be included in our metrics in this application.\n\nThrough our GIVbacks program, we reward donors to verified projects with GIV on Optimism, having distributed  6.64 million GIV on OP Mainnet (from launch to June 11, 2024).  \n\nAs an additional onboarding effort for high-trust community members, we have been offering 25 OP to each project on Giveth who passes our verification system requirements, and adds an Optimism recipient address (296 projects onboarded so far). \n\nTo enhance these onboarding efforts, we have been running quadratic funding rounds that require verified projects to add an Optimism address, with matching pools on Optimism so far totaling approximately $83,000. \n\n## How it works\n\nGiveth goes beyond “just donations” with the following features:\n\n* GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects get rewarded with GIV on OP Mainnet. This flips the script on tax-deductible donation, creating a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.\n* GIVpower - Users can lock their GIV tokens on OP Mainnet to earn a yield and get GIVpower. People can use GIVpower to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower are ranked higher, and in turn, their donors are rewarded with more GIVbacks, similar to the veToken model. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!\n* Quadratic Funding - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.\n\n## Who uses it\n\nCurrently, over 3,400 projects have raised $2.8m from 58,600+ donations from over 16,600 donor addresses on Giveth. \n\nTo understand how deep our link with the Optimism ecosystem is, if we consider only Optimism numbers, we have 799 projects, 4012 donors, 17,500+ donations, and $329k+.\n\nProjects that want to get to the next level can apply to be “Verified” as a public goods creator, providing information about their impact history and reputation at stake.\n\nGiveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new ecosystems of donors, while inspiring them to dive deeper down the blockchain rabbit hole.\n\nSo far in 2024, we have made HUGE progress, running four quadratic funding rounds supporting donations on Optimism with the following results:\n\nTotal in matching pools: $107,563\nIndividual donations: $65,500\nProjects participating: 249 \nUnique donors: 1914\nDonations: 1433\n\nGiving Season Round  (December 19, 2023 - January 2, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/qf-giving-season-round-results-december-19-2023-january-2-2024/1305\n\nMetaPool APAC Round (February 19-29, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/meta-pool-apac-qf-round-results-feb-19-29-2024/1358\n\nENS Builders Round (March 25-April 8, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/ens-builders-qf-round-march-25-april-8-2024/1410\n\nGalactic Giving Round (May 2-16, 2024)\nhttps://forum.giveth.io/t/galactic-giving-round-results-may-2-16-2024/1445\n\nWe also launched loads of features including a custom donation widget, a project curation program, and streaming donations.\n\nWe sincerely thank the Optimistic community for allowing us to participate and build in such a fantastic ecosystem.",

Our goal is to create an ecosystem of web3 applications, based on our own token that powers our platforms and services. Additionally, we offer education through interactive workshops, both in-person and digital, to facilitate user integration into the blockchain ecosystem.\nBlockchain: The JEFE token is developed Open source under the MIT license,  coded in Solidity and forms the foundation of the project, deployed on the mainnet in Optimism as $JEFE with the vision of being part of the SUPERCHAIN.\n\nApplication Development: We implement web3 activities within the community, promoting healthy competition through participation in educational workshops and learning activities on blockchain usage. All information is accessible to users from our website and with direct support on our social media channels. We have our own video game, Jefe Zombie, available on Android and iOS. This game introduces users to using their ERC-20 address to rank within the community and earn on-chain rewards, such as $JEFE & NFTs, and off-chain rewards, such as game appearances & accessories.\n\nCommunity Support: We also support community talent in areas like sports (American football and paintball), audiovisual art, helping artists transition to the web3 world, and e-sports, promoting competition and game streaming among users.\n\nJEFE University: We have JEFE University, a tour of presentations  and workshops at universities about Optimism, blockchain & web3. We generate POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol) for attendees, promoting learning and knowledge sharing.\n\nRewards Program: We incentivize talent and user engagement within our ecosystem through a comprehensive rewards program, prominently featured on our website. Additionally, we're currently developing JEFE COMPASS, an innovative mobile Dapp where users can seamlessly monitor the global community ranking, organize activities, and track both on-chain and off-chain interactions from community addresses and VOTE for events, competitions, top players and more. By participating, users earn rewards points, enabling them to evolve their progress and level of their ranking within the community. \nThis program recurrently lists community activities that integrate web3, providing an access point to understand the use case of JEFE TOKEN. We act as a compass for navigating the web3 world, with a vision of a Superchain. Our utility is to support the transition from web2 to its integration with the Superchain in web3 interactively.",

    contributionDescription:
      "My name is Aspyn and I'm an onchain NFT artist. I like to explore what blockchain art can do that real world art can not do.\n\nMy project is Based NFTs, which are a series of composable interactive fully onchain NFT collections that I created on Base. The metadata and art for all of these collections is stored fully onchain and each collection is composable onchain, meaning the art for each NFT can be included in another onchain collection simply by referencing the NFT's smart contract.\n\nThe first collection was a limited supply collection representing the first fully onchain interactive version of Steamboat Willie, titled Onchain Steamboat Willie. With Onchain Steamboat Willies, the art is composable, which means other onchain NFT collections could use the Steamboat Willie art in their art simply by referencing the Onchain Steamboat Willie smart contracts. Onchain Steamboat Willies minted out with a supply of 1111. \n\nThis takes us to my next collection: Pop Willies.\n\nPop Willies are onchain generative pop art that blend the old school, iconic hand-drawn Steamboat Willie with blockchain-enabled digital art composability. Each Pop Willie is created from multiple Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs. By minting a Pop Willie NFT, you'd also receive the 4 (or 9) Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs that make up your Pop Willie's art. Furthermore, at any point, if you collect a new Onchain Steamboat Willie, you could add that Steamboat Willie your Pop Willie NFT's art by simply calling the \"paintWillies4\" function on the Pop Willies smart contract, allowing you to forever modify your NFT's art through onchain art composability. Pop Willies minted out with a supply of 300.\n\nThe third collection is Based Moon, which was an open edition dropped on both X and (via open-source frame) on Farcaster. I believe Based Moon is the first fully onchain moon art on Base that updates its phase in real-time with the phase of the real world moon by using the current block-time. The Based Moon open edition mint concluded with 1805 moons minted.\n\nFor my day job, I am a protocol engineer at OpenSea. During my free time, I work on NFT projects and various crypto-related experiments.",

This reduces phishing risk and creates a safe NFT/DeFi ecosystem on Optimism, just as we\'ve seen on Ethereum.

Users and institutions link their cold wallets with hot wallets on delegate.xyz, and then the hot wallet can act on behalf of the cold wallet, like crypto power-of-attorney.

Coop Records is an end-to-end service provider responsible for facilitating the vast majority of mints for our artists.\n\nWe are the biggest power user of Boost and placed first in every week of the Boost Creator Fund over the course of May as seen here: https://dune.com/boost_xyz/boost-creator-fund/b9be8e45-93dc-4ea7-83e4-23d23899e9f7\n\nOutside of releasing music onchain, Coop Records is active as a product builder - having incubated projects like:\n\n- Sonata.tips - a music discovery platform on Farcaster\n- Boombox.fm - a consumer crypto app to share your favorite artists\n- Farconcert - onchain tickets for the Farcon official afterparty\n- Frame Generator - a recurring tool to generate new Frames for every Coop Records releases.\n\nThe main focus being onchain points systems deployed on a Base L3 in partnership with Stack. Our contracts have facilitated more than 150k transactions - largely from users who have never touched crypto before. https://explorer.stack.so/address/0xab18FdC21c33c3C60bbcA753997a657F00d43F9e\n\nWe’re actively growing our onchain subscribers through Coop Records Club - a partnership with Hypersub which gives our community of 250 collectors an airdrop of every release.\nhttps://hypersub.withfabric.xyz/collection/coop-records-club-izh68wci0c8w\n\nCoop Records recently started a new podcast series - which has driven 23k mints across our first 5 episodes. https://pods.media/coop-records\n\nCoop Records also participated as a judge in the We Love the Art competition and helped 25+ artists apply.\n\nAs a record label - it is important for Coop Records to build on top of underlying platforms and protocols. We believe our impact is noticeable and tangible - and wanted to apply for the Onchain Builders round as a more direct way of receiving OP to reinvest into our artists and our community.\n\nWe are in close contact with partners like Sound, Pods, Boost and Layer3 about their Onchain Builder application - but want to vocalize that we have been instrumental in the impact these projects have made on their contracts.\n\nAs a capable dev team - the results of this round will be crucial in our decision to keep building on these shared platforms, versus deciding to build our own. We believe strongly in the network effects of shared contracts, but will not sacrifice our ability to capture value for our artists if it boxes us out of being able to tangibly measure and show the impact we are creating onchain.\n\nWe hope that this description can shine a light on the full scope of the Coop Records ecosystem and look forward to continuing to champion Optimism and Retro Funding in the years to come.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration,\n\nCoop Records Team',

An Access Pass grants its holder with governance rights in the form of voting on the artist, and acts as an entry point into Botto\'s ecosystem. The DAO recently created a new ERC-1155 contract to bring the Access Pass to Base, providing a free mint to any voting participant on Farcaster via Frames. Over 9600 voting participants joined in on this meaning making process.\n\nIn the coming two months, the DAO will be bridging the BOTTO token (ERC-20) from Mainnet to Base, providing protocol owned liquidity to continue our journey on democratizing art. Accompanying this, the DAO is to offer all users the ability to claim its voting rewards in ETH.

It enabled us to issue affordable NFTs at a fraction of the cost, opening the door for a broader audience.\n\nThis strategic pivot to L2 was met with remarkable success. We have issued millions of NFTs, democratizing access to digital assets. Our most popular NFT boasts over 100,000 holders, a testament to our approach of making NFTs accessible and valuable across multiple blockchains.\n\nOur vision is to continue this trajectory, enhancing the utility and engagement of our NFTs.

    contributionDescription:
      "“1099-DA” is an AI generated, interactive piece of art. It employs AI, game mechanics, humor, and NFTs to satirize the regulatory landscape of blockchain in the US. The project allows collectors to experience the overwhelming requirement of the newly proposed 1099-DA form. A low estimate of 8-9 Billion of these forms will be submitted to the IRS if the rules go into effect.\n\n\n“1099-DA” is composed of 1099 NFTs, which showcase caricature-like portraits of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel on different types of currency. The images were created using a series of custom trained Stable Diffusion models (more on the exact process below).\n\n\n“1099-DA” utilizes custom smart contracts to engage collectors with a parody of the proposed 1099-DA form. NFT owners can call the 'exchangeCurrency' function, altering their NFT’s metadata. Each NFT can be changed to show a different political appointee; Gensler, Yellen, or Werfel. Changing an NFT will create a satirical, AI-generated 1099-DA form. Collectors then have the opportunity to mint the 1099 as an NFT by calling the ‘submit1099ToIRS’ function. This not only adds another unique AI-generated NFT to their collection but allows them to experience the ridiculousness of generating and submitting these forms for simply ‘exchanging’ their NFT. The prompts and data used to create these fake documents are pulled from the meta-data of the NFTs in the project. This real-world use case of tracking input and output data for AI with NFTs is overlooked by current regulators.\n\n\nIf the “1099-DA” collection ever hits a critical majority, where two-thirds of NFTs are changed to the same appointee, every NFT in the series will permanently lock to showcase that appointee. This mechanism is analogous to congress clarifying the regulatory landscape with a two-thirds vote. This is a twist for collectors as their NFTs may unpredictably shift from rare to common or vice-versa.\n\n\nBelow outlines the process used for creating the images of the NFTs. Each image is purely AI-generated, there was no post-processing (e.g. Photoshop) of any output images:\n\n\nSeveral V2.1-768px Stable Diffusion models were trained to generate distinct and iconic types of US currency from 1870s Gold Certificates to present day Federal Reserve Notes.\nThousands of currency images were generated and curated down to 12 based on their style and aesthetic. Particular attention was paid to curating images with similar framing and drop shadows (these were not added or changed in post processing software).\nNext several new Stable Diffusion models were trained to generate caricatures in the likeness of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel.\nUsing Stable Diffusion’s Automatic1111 interface, humorous images of the appointees were inpainted onto the 12 currency types. 10,000+ images were generated and curated into a final set of 1099 for each appointee.\nFinally, for the rarest currency type, the Gold Certificate, the artist used a special process with inpainting in Automatic1111 to add the words “Gold God.” This element was added purely in Stable Diffusion. No post-processing software (e.g. photoshop) was used on the output images.",

    contributionDescription:
      "Rising UK-based electronic artist and producer Jamie Reddington (aka Sound of Fractures) announces his groundbreaking project, \"Scenes.” The interactive album invites fans to contribute their favourite memories and photographs in response to each of the record’s songs, encouraging a lean-in, emotional connection that’s been lost in our passive streaming environment. It transforms passive listeners into co-creators. \n\n“Music isn't just about sound; it's about the memories and emotions they evoke. ‘Scenes’ is an effort to give a tangible form to this abstract connection and capture it in something we can recognise,” shares Reddington. “Each song and its accompanying ‘Scenes’ will populate a digital gallery – an archive that's a living testament to how music interacts with life moments in today's social media-dominated era.\"\n\nOver 300 listeners have contributed Scenes, embarking upon what fans are calling a “journey through the rich tapestry of our inner worlds.” The BBC Radio-featured artist and web3 pioneer chooses one Scene to be each track’s primary artwork, and then all the personal moment submitted are encapsulated onchain as a digital collectables that forever links artist and listener. Scenes reaches into real world audiences and makes an emotional connection and invites them to consider what owning this digital artefact of the moment means to them (a function that only the blockchain can offer\n). The project will be displayed as an interactive physical exhibition at the Future of Music Conference and other music festivals, offering an example of how to rethink creative releases and allowing people to collect the Scenes that resonate with them in IRL as the project goes on a physical tour.\n\nScenes comprises of 6 interactive rounds where the singles are presented to the audiences pre release so that when the song and its respective gallery goes love they have already formed an emoitnal bond and contributed. For each scene of the 6 scenes a limited music NFT (the song and Gif of all submissions) is released via Manifold and a the gallery collection goes live as a Zora collection displaying and recording all audience member submissions as individual pieces of artwork. This allow for different collector profiles to connect with the project: Those who want a limited song, those who want to own their Scene and those who discover Scene that resonates with them and want to collect it.\n\n“Scenes” is Reddington’s most salient experiment to date. It builds upon a reputation based as much on championing music communities as his unique sonic signature, which blends elements of Jamie XX and Burial with found sounds like his daughter’s heartbeat.\n\nScenes aims to re-imagine the music album as an ongoing collaborative piece of performance art that explores the relationship between memories, music and our online selves to form an archive onchain of each contributors encapsulated experience.  \n\nMore about Sound of Fractures:\nJamie’s previous success, with tracks like the euphoric 'Real Friends’' and club-heavy 'Let Go, have showcased his distinctive synthesis of films, stories, and human emotions in his music. Sound of Fractures takes elements of Jamie XX and Burial and mixes it with found sounds, like his daughter’s heartbeat and day to day life to create a unique form of deeply emotional electronic music. This time, with \"Scenes\", he goes a step further, seeking to challenge the traditional album format. Instead of offering passive consumption, he sparks an active dialogue with listeners by intertwining personal stories and music. Through this new project listeners are not just passive consumers but active collaborators.  The concept of world-building is central to Jamie's vision. In an era where music has become commodified, and artist identities often diluted, Sound of Fractures offers an alternative. “World Building is forging these connections that create strong emotional bonds around an artist's music. In today's digital life, music isn't just a product; it's an entire world that fans should desire to engage with, to be part of,\" Jamie articulates.\nWith the fusion of web2 and web3, as previously seen in his 'IRL' EP, Jamie is no stranger to the frontier of the digital and physical crossovers. His exploration of how to re-think music releases has not only positioned him as a pioneer but has also showcased the potential of new technology in building artist-audience relationships without big tech gatekeepers. As Jamie succinctly puts it, \"Web3 isn't an 'or'; it's an 'and, a tool’'. A new dimension of creative freedom. It's about breaking the mold, starting new conversations, and forging genuine relationships with our fans. The future for independent artists is uncertain, but we can keep experimenting and find new approaches that bring more value to both musicians and fans\". While building a strong community across his socials by challenging the current narratives of music careers, the Scenes project offers creators a real world example of how things can be done differently.",

To achieve massive adoption of the technology, it's crucial to offer a simple, unified interface that seamlessly harnesses the capabilities of underlying blockchain technologies. \n\nFarcaster Frames holds the promise of setting a new standard for dApp interaction within social media contexts. However, bridging the gap between user interfaces and the diverse functionalities of various blockchains remains a challenge.\n\nThrough the development of the MarketSense framework and frames, we are poised to address this challenge within the Farcaster ecosystem. Our architecture enables seemless communication with underlying blockchains, facilitating the implementation of sophisticated system behaviors and enhancing user experience.",
