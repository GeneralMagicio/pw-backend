However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger. We are working with them to make signer proxy perfect and production ready.',

      'The Book of Optimism Fault Proof\n\nThe Book of Optimism Fault Proof repository is a resource aimed at demystifying the fault proof system for newcomers and seasoned developers alike. Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.\n\n1. Starting with the Basics\n\nThe journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.\n\n2. Key Components Explained\n\nFault Proof: At its core, the fault proof mechanism replaces centralized proposer systems, which are susceptible to biases and inefficiencies, with a decentralized, game-theory-based approach.\nFault Proof Game: This component employs a binary search technique to pinpoint and verify discrepancies between parties on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in dispute resolution.\nCannon: An off-chain program, Cannon is pivotal in generating verifiable data needed for on-chain interactions, bridging the gap between theoretical fault proof and practical implementation.\nop-program: This tool provides the necessary prototype files for Cannon, facilitating services for pre-image data crucial for the system’s operations.\nop-challenger: Automating the gameplay elements of the fault proof system, op-challenger utilizes both Cannon and op-program to streamline processes and enhance system integrity.\n\n3. Architecture Mechanics\n\nUnderstanding the architecture of the fault proof system involves exploring how these components work together to form a robust mechanism. From the deployment of smart contracts and proxies on the Ethereum blockchain, identified by specific addresses such as MIPS and DisputeGameFactoryProxy, to the integration of off-chain computations with on-chain verifications, the architecture is designed for scalability and security.\n\n4. Comprehensive Resources\n\nFurther enriching this document, an extensive collection of articles and videos is summarized, providing deep dives into each component and the fault proof mechanism as a whole. These resources are meticulously curated to extend learning beyond the initial explanations, offering insights into potential applications and optimizations of the fault proof system.\n\n5. For Newcomers and Experts\n\nWhether you are a new entrant eager to understand the basics or an expert looking to refine your knowledge of decentralized systems, the repository offers a wealth of information designed to bring all readers up to speed on the innovative fault proof system.\n',

            "\"The 'Book of Optimism Fault Proof' repository is an resource aimed at demystifying the fault proof system for newcomers and seasoned developers alike. Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.\n\nStarting with the Basics The journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.",

The Basic tasks  enable beginners to get the hang of web3 basics through coding examples, while the Project task section delves in to the architecture and processes of classic projects and dissects the key logic within the code。\n- Adhering to the concept of the open-source university, we regularly hold online tech-sharing sessions (typically once a week), with over 180 deep dives into hard-core technical topics. They're all up on platforms like YouTube and Bilibili for people to catch up on. For critical technologies or topics, we have organized several lecture series, such as DeFi series, ZK Series Courses, Optimism, Starknet, Scroll, UniswapV3, Account Abstraction, etc. Excellent presenters would receive a 160 DAI reward provided by the community funding pool.\n- We have a special team to translate influential English courses or articles into Chinese, making them accessible to a broader range of Chinese developers. To help learners understand the entire web3 industry's context and improve systemic cognition, we have organized the content of MIT 15.S12 Blockchain and Money (Prof. Gary Gensler) video course and translated it into Chinese version course notes.\n- We've built a community system using Ethereum Address as an identity marker, offering platforms for hiring and bounties alongside practical web3 tools like Redpacket and Airdrop, etc., on which we support layer2 (Optimism, Arbitrum one, scroll, zkSync Era, etc). We're continuously enhancing our community features with the goal of providing an enriched experience for our developers. We aim to foster learning, facilitate collaboration, and unlock new opportunities within the community.\n- We adhere to a DAO governance, decentralized, with global contributors, voting on significant community .\n\n",

      'Runtime Verification has been at the forefront of open-source formal verification tools for more than a decade. Our generalistic approach allows us to use our technology on multiple blockchains. While KEVM offers our verification infrastructure to all EVM-based smart contracts, Kontrol greatly reduces the barrier to entry to formal verification for Solidity smart contracts.\nOur tooling is completely open source and freely accessible to all developers of the Optimism ecosystem at no additional cost.\n\nKEVM is an EVM executable formal semantics written in the K framework. KEVM passes all Ethereum conformance tests and is the entry point for formally verifying smart contracts with the K framework. However, using plain KEVM requires ad-hoc training on the K framework to write specifications. Additionally, these specifications can be quite verbose, increasing the difficulty of writing them.\n\nKontrol solves this by allowing developers to write the formal specification of their smart contracts directly as Foundry property tests. These tests are automatically translated into KEVM specifications, keeping all the verification guarantees whilst allowing for a much more easy developer experience.',

Simply put, Kontrol combines KEVM and Foundry to grant smart contract developers the ability to perform formal verification without learning a new language or tool through the use of symbolic property testing.

We also support any custom binaries, node settings, and sidecar applications that the user request. \n\nOur infrastructure maintains snapshots, enabling fast node deployment near the chain tip, and takes care of upgrades, monitoring, and any custom configurations.   The user has the option to deploy nodes on their servers, or our global network of high performance baremetal servers.  This enables super low latency access at a low cost.\n\nHigh-profile projects like Goldsky, 0x, Indexing Company, and Test In Prod have been using BlockJoy nodes throughout the past year.\n\nThe next phase of our project will enable self-serve access for users to integrate custom binaries and images, creating a truly self-serve rollup-as-a-service platform running on high-performance bare metal servers.",

This allows OP-Chains to develop, test, and verify changes independently, without the need to continuously monitor L1 changes.\n\nThe local deployment capabilities of our package enable rapid feedback cycles during development, while the built-in multi-client support ensures interoperability across different clients. We have collaborated with the op-reth, op-erigon, and op-nethermind node teams to verify and fix bugs using the Optimism package.\n",
